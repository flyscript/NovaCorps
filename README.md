This is a game that I created for one of my first C++ modules during my Bachelors degree.

It's a Galaxians-come-Space Invaders style game set in space, where you defend your ship from waves of enemy ships coming at you.

Key features:
Custom animation system
Custom particle system
Custom random number generator
Custom events sequence manager
